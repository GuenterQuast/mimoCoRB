#  Application example for mimoCoRB
#  --------------------------------
#
# three buffers:
#  - RB_1 for (simuated) raw wavforms
#  - RB_2 for selected double-pulses
#  - RB_3 for derived pulse parameters
#
#  data from RB_2 and RB_3 are saved to files in tarred parquet format
#  or in text format.
#
#  data from RB_2 are passed to an observer process driving a real-time display
#
# Notes:
# 
#    1. additional config files controlling the user functions are
#       located in the subdirectory config/
#    2. user necessary application-specific user code is located
#       in the subdirectory modules/
